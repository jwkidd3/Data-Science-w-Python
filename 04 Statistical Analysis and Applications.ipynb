    "Unsurprisingly, advanced models such as neural networks and support vector machines rely on linear algebra as their \"trick\" for impressive speedups. Modern-day GPUs are essentially linear algebra supercomputers. And, to utilize their power on a GPU, models must often be carefully formulated in terms of vectors and matrices.\n",

    "Covariance is a measure of the joint probability of two random variables. It shows the similarity of those variables, which means that if the greater and lesser values of the one variable mainly correspond to the ones from the second variable, the covariance is positive. If the opposite happens then the covariance is negative. If it is approximately or equal to zero, the variables are independent from each other. It is often represented as cov(X, Y), σxʏ or σ(X, Y) for two variables X and Y and its formal definition is: the expected value of the product of their deviations from their individual expected values(arithmetic mean).\n"
